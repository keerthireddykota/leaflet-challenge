# Earth Quake Analysis


## Project Overview

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data on natural hazards, ecosystem and environmental health, and the impacts of climate and land-use changes. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to deliver timely, relevant, and actionable information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is looking to build a new set of tools to effectively visualize the vast amounts of earthquake data they collect daily from around the world. While they gather extensive data, they currently lack a meaningful way to display it. In this challenge, your task is to develop a visualization solution that will help the USGS better communicate their findings to the public, government organizations, and other stakeholders, with the goal of raising awareness and securing additional funding for addressing the pressing issues facing our planet.



## Result
Here, you can find pop-ups that offer additional information about each earthquake when you click on a marker.

This visualization shows all earthquakes that have occurred worldwide over the past 7 days.
